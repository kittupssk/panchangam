# Panchangam - Hora Chakram

A single-page Telugu panchangam and daily hora chart, served by GitHub Pages from `index.html`.
Owner: Krishna. Users read it mostly in Telugu, often on phones.

## Files

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/hora-chart.html` | **The source. Edit this.** Page body: styles, markup, the calculation engine (script 1, `PJ`) and the app (script 2). |
| `index.html` | **Built file. Never edit by hand.** `npm run build` wraps `src/hora-chart.html` in a full HTML document. GitHub Pages serves it. |
| `data/book-data.js` | Times transcribed from the reference book (30 Oct 2026 – 7 Apr 2027): tithi, nakshatra, yogam end times, varjyam starts, sunrise/sunset, lagna end times (14 Oct 2026 – 6 Apr 2027). |
| `data/book-pages/` | Photos of the book pages the data came from. Check these when a book value looks wrong. |
| `tests/` | `accuracy.js` (engine vs book), `ui.js` (layout/behaviour on desktop, phone, phone sideways, te/en), `paste.js` (WhatsApp paste). |
| `tools/build.js` | Build / `--check` that `index.html` matches the source. |
| `tools/moodham-gen.js` | Regenerates the Guru/Sukra moudhyam table (uses `astronomy-engine`). |

## Commands

```
npm install && npx playwright install chromium   # once
npm run build        # src/hora-chart.html -> index.html
npm test             # build check + accuracy + UI + paste; must pass before any commit
```
Screenshots from `npm run test:ui` land in `test-output/` (git-ignored). Look at them after any visual change.

## The reference: the book wins

- The reference is a Telugu panchangam book for **Rajahmundry** (lat 17.50, lon 82.45). When the WhatsApp channel and the book differ, **follow the book**.
- The engine is Surya Siddhanta with constants fitted to the book (`MOON_FIX`, `SUN_FIX`, `EOT_K`, `SHIFT_MIN` …). Do not change them without running `npm run test:accuracy` before and after, and only keep a change that improves it.
- Current fit (page minus book): tithi rms ≈1.8 min, nakshatra ≈3.0, varjyam ≈2.9, yogam ≈2.3, sunrise ≈0.8, lagna ≈2.8 (not fitted). A few book entries are known outliers (listed in `tests/accuracy.js` with reasons).
- Sunrise/sunset: Sun's centre, no refraction, at Rajahmundry.
- Varjyam and Amrutakalam: start ghati tables per nakshatra, 4 ghatis long (tables in the source; verified against the book).
- Durmuhurtham, Rahu kalam, Yamagandam: from **actual sunrise to sunset** (day in 8 parts for Rahu/Yama). Not the 6 AM–6 PM convention the channel uses. Pasted Rahu/Yama values are ignored on purpose.
- Abhijit muhurtham: 8th of the 15 day muhurtas (sunrise to sunset). Abhijit lagnam (book's definition): the **4th lagna from the lagna at sunrise**, i.e. 4th rashi from the Sun's rashi at the Rajahmundry sunrise, shown as one item with its full rising period that day (around midday). Not the lagna(s) during the muhurtham window. Lagna is worked out at Rajahmundry (ascendant from sidereal time; ayanamsa = modern tropical Sun − engine Sun, so lagna at sunrise = Sun). The town offset moves both, as the book does for muhurtham lagnas. Lagna end times checked against the book's lagnantha table (1,656 times, 14 Oct 2026 - 6 Apr 2027): rms ≈2.8 min, max ≈5.8; the engine runs ≈2.4 min early on average (likely a small ayanamsa difference plus the book's simplified ~4 min/day table). This is a reference check only: the owner does not want the lagna adjusted to match the book.
- Moudhyam: Guru within 11° of the Sun; Sukra within 10° (8° while retrograde). Precomputed table 2025–2040 from modern positions (may differ from the book by about a day).
- Masam is amanta, named by the rashi the Sun enters; samvatsaram changes at Ugadi.

## Town offset (desantara)

- Towns table follows the book: "+" means earlier, "−" later; local time = Rajahmundry time − offset. Default town Hyderabad.
- The offset applies to sunrise, sunset, horas, durmuhurtham, Rahu kalam, Yamagandam, Abhijit muhurtham and lagnam.
- It does **not** apply to tithi, nakshatra, varjyam, amrutakalam, yogam, karanam (they are the same instant everywhere) unless the user ticks the "apply to all" box.
- The day is the **town's** sunrise to its next sunrise (`dayWindow`): it decides which tithis, nakshatras, yogams, karanams, varjyams and amrutakalams are listed for a date, the taras, the masam/paksham line and the green bars. With "apply to all" ticked the shown times already move by the offset, so the real window stays Rajahmundry's.
- Sunrise/sunset for a town = Rajahmundry's minus the offset (the book's method), not calculated from the town's latitude.

## Hora

- Day hora = (sunset − sunrise)/12; night hora = (next sunrise − sunset)/12. First hora lord = weekday lord, then Chaldean order: Surya, Sukra, Budha, Chandra, Sani, Guru, Kuja.
- Lord labels: Telugu first syllable; English two letters (Sk for Sukra). Guru/Sukra green, Sani/Kuja red.
- Good times (green bars) use the user's rules from "శుభ సమయాల నియమాలు" (saved per device, take effect only on **Apply**). Defaults: Guru/Sukra/Budha/Chandra hora; no durmuhurtham or varjyam; tithi 2,3,5,7,10,11,13 of both pakshas + Shukla Chaturdashi, Purnima, Bahula Padyami; tara 2,4,6,8,9 when a janma nakshatra is set; windows ≥ 5 min.

## Telugu text conventions (follow the book everywhere)

- Time prefixes ఉ. / ప. / సా. / రా. / తె., time as h.mm, a space after the prefix: `ఉ. 6.15`.
- Ranges use ల with spaces: `ఉ. 6.15 ల 7.46`. Next day: ` (+1)` with a space before it.
- హోర (short ఓ), not హోరా — but keep హోరాధిపతి.
- No AM/PM in Telugu. English uses `06:15 AM`.
- No good/bad words (మంచిది/చెడ్డది) in the hora tables. Never mention the book's publisher name on the page.
- Every user-visible string exists in both `I18N.te` and `I18N.en`. English is a translation of the Telugu, not a separate wording.

## Layout rules

- Dark theme only. Telugu is the default language. Default date = the **current panchangam day**: today from the town's sunrise, yesterday's date before it (its night horas hold the current hora). Until the user picks a date, the page follows the clock and moves on at sunrise.
- Panchangam: two columns on wide screens (main details left; yogam, karanam, Rahu kalam, Yamagandam, rashis, Abhijit, moudhyam right), one column on phones.
- Main hora band and 10-day bands are the same size. On upright phones they scroll sideways and start at the current time. Phones held sideways (`html.land-phone`, set from the real screen orientation) show the band first and taller.
- The 10-day section starts from the selected date (default today) and its heading names the start date (`dd/mm నుండి 10 రోజుల పంచాంగం`). The today label, highlight, now line and tara Now chip appear only on the current panchangam day's row, if it is among the 10 days.
- 10-day day card (tooltip): line 1 date · day · sunrise/sunset; line 2 samvatsaram · ayanam · rutuvu · masam · paksham (each item kept on one line); then tithi, nakshatra and the other rows.
- Tarabalam: a day can have 2–3 taras; the one running now is highlighted with a ఇప్పుడు / Now chip (panel and today's 10-day card). "Now" is inside the day from the town's sunrise to the next town sunrise.
- Paste box: holds an editable sample in the page's language (the WhatsApp channel's Telugu layout, or its English translation with AM/PM times). Pasting over the untouched sample replaces it; applying the untouched sample saves nothing; the reader accepts either language.
- No horizontal scrolling of the page itself at 390 px width.
- The page is also published as a Claude artifact, where the frame grows to full height and blocks geolocation, so never rely on scrolling inside the page or on media queries for orientation.

## How to work

1. Edit `src/hora-chart.html` only. Keep changes small and in the style of the surrounding code.
2. `npm run build`, then `npm test`. Fix anything that fails. Look at the screenshots for visual changes.
3. Commit with a clear message. `index.html` and `src/hora-chart.html` are always committed together.
4. When a rule above changes, update this file in the same commit.
